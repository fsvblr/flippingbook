# Flipping Book (for Laravel)

## About

Flipping Book package allows you to create digital content like e-books, online magazines, products catalogues with page flip, reader-friendly controls and embed them right on your Laravel site.

This Flipping Book package is developed to make your digital publications look realistic, personalized and attract customersâ€™ attention. People can flip pages of e-book, online newspaper, etc., with a finger touch and feel like holding a real one.

Flipping book consists of an administrative part and a public part. The administrative panel consists of 3 parts: categories, publications, pages. The publication page is based on the uploaded page image. Multiple page uploads into one publication from a zip archive are available.

If you want to turn a source file in **PDF format into a Flipping Book**, you can first use any of the many online 
services "pdf to png", and then upload a zip with pictures to the publication with one click.

The public part consists of a list of categories, a list of publications and viewing publications in Flipping Book format.

The [flipbook-vue](https://github.com/ts1/flipbook-vue) and [Vuetify slider](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/sliders/) scripts were used to display Flipping Book.

            "url": "https://github.com/fsvblr/flippingbook"

## Please note

- It is assumed that your site has user [authentication](https://laravel.com/docs/authentication). If it does not, then the simplest option is [laravel/ui](https://packagist.org/packages/laravel/ui).
- Don't forget to wrap flippingbook's admin routes with access check.
- Don't forget to create a storage link on your site if you haven't done so yet:
```
php artisan storage:link
```
- The ImageMagick and Zip extensions are dependencies in this project.
- The package is tested on Laravel Framework 11.40.0.
